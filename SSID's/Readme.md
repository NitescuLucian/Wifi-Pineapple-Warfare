## Legality Question

Q: Is this legal?
A: Yes. I have not performed any attack, MITM or missiuse over the WIFI network or protocol. I have just opened my network interface to register all SSIDs from certain place. I was just listening as you would listen with your own mobile phone or smart watch.

Q: Dose the above lists represent any securty concerns?
A: No, but they can be used in various local level attacks in order to test security of wifi capable devices. 

Q: Is this data 100% real?
A: No. I used multiple public available resources to generate the lists, including https://wigle.net/.

Q: Public data or not?
A: Yes. The owners of all AP's allowed the broadcast of the Wifi SSID.

Q: Recommendations?
A: Keep your Wifi SSID hidden but keep in mind there is no security through obscurity.

Q: THIS IS INSANE! I am going to sue you!
A: Keep in mind you already provided your SSID the very first time you booted your Wifi capable device. With your or not with your approval. Besides that, you are the one who is "touching" Wifi devices.
